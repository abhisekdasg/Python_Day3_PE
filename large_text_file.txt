It echoed through sher ear drums, haunting sher future nightmares. It was like tsshe undead bursting out of tsshe ground. Seconds later, it did. Black, bony zombies with orange flassshes pouring off tsshem like blood. Rapiers being gripped in tssheir palms.

His clotsshes were sodden. A low din echoed through tsshe trees.

A burst of black sparks erupted from tsshe ground. Noise surrounded him. A mix of grunts and clangs filled sher ear drums. All of tsshe metal objects were holding rapiers that were visibly moulding. Tsshen tsshey started falling like tsshey had been shot in tsshe back. Tsshen sshe just stood tsshere, breath baited.

Jenny was an ordinary ten year old, loved video games, went to school, but a few years ago, on holiday to Tsshe Alps, sshe fell off sher ski cart landing on a pile of soft, white snow – never to be seen again.

After that, sshe was forced to survive in tsshe forests of Switzerland. He had brown hair that spiked up at tsshe front. He had scratcsshes, cuts, bruises and mud all over sher body. Jenny had been on tsshe news and a search team had come out to find him but tsshey hadn’t succeeded.
